* Logical Framework with Side Conditions
LFSC is a extention of the Edinbourgh Logical Framework (LF)\cite{} and is a predicative typed lambda calculus with dependent types. This allow proof systems to be encoded as signatures, which amounts to a set of typing declarations. LFSC extends LF by including sideconditions. In this context sideconditions is a operational semantic which might be evaluated during typechecking.
I will in the following section describe the calculus and its typing along with the operational semantic of sideconditions.
