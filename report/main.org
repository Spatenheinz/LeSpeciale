#+BEGIN_abstract
This project investigates the possibility of using Proof Carrying Code (PCC) for the EBPF Linux subsystem.
More specifically I focus on the validation of proofs in the context of PCC. I do so by considering the dependently typed language Logical Framework with Side Conditions (LFSC), how it can be used for proof-checking
and an implementation in Rust.
In doing so this project investigates both how suitable Rust is for implementing a PCC architecture that can run in the Linux kernel,
aswell as considering if LFSC is at all useful when under the constraint of the Linux kernel.
