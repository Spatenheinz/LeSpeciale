* TODO Experiments
  - Take some examples, (for instance from Mads Thesis and check the proofs and see if the new format will let the updated ebpf syscall allow programs to load)
  - obviously also check that it will reject programs that either does not match the program (if this can even happen by design), or if the proof is unsatisfiable.
  - We really want the functionality to be non-blocking. Is this easy or difficult in Rust and in the Kernel?

* TODO Evaluation
  - Videnskabsteori: Hypothesis etc.
    - Correctness
    - Expressiveness
    - Performance
    - Ease of use?
    - maybe more???
